					<h3 id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
					<p> Step 1 In a shallow bowl, combine panko, garlic powder, and 1 cup Parmesan. Into another shallow bowl, pour flour. In a third shallow bowl, beat eggs with 1 tablespoon water. Step 2 Pat chicken dry; season with salt and pepper. Dip into flour, shaking off excess, then into egg, then into panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere. Step 3 In a small bowl, mix mozzarella and remaining 1 cup Parmesan. Step 4 Heat broiler. In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, heat oil until a deep-fry or instant-read thermometer registers 350°; if it smokes a bit, that’s okay. Set a wire rack in a baking sheet. Step 5 Working one at a time, fry chicken until one side is golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip and continue to fry until golden brown on the other side and the sound of the frying chicken gets slightly louder—this is the moisture evaporating from the chicken—about 1 minute more. Transfer to prepared rack. Repeat with remaining chicken. Spoon some marinara over chicken. Sprinkle with cheese mixture. Step 6 Broil, watching carefully, until cheese is melted and brown spots form, about 2 minutes. Step 7 Divide chicken among plates. Top with basil. Serve with remaining marinara alongside.

				  <h3 id="beef">Beef</h3>
					<p>
                        Step 1 Preheat oven to 350°. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add ground beef and cook until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Drain fat. Step 2 Return beef mixture to skillet over medium heat. Add chili powder and cumin and season with salt and pepper, then stir in enchilada sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in corn and black beans. Step 3 Add a large scoop of meat mixture onto each tortilla and roll up. Place rolled up tortillas side by side in a 9"-x-13" baking dish and top with cheeses.

                        RICE: Step 1 In a fine-mesh strainer, rinse rice under cold water until water runs clear. In a medium pot, combine rice, kombu (if using), and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let rice steam 10 minutes. Discard kombu. Fluff rice with a fork. Step 2 Meanwhile, in a small heatproof bowl, microwave vinegar, sugar, and salt in 30-second increments, stirring between each, until sugar and salt are dissolved. Step 3 Transfer cooked rice to a baking sheet, then carefully pat in an even layer. Sprinkle with vinegar mixture. Using a sushi paddle of flat wooden spoon, mix vinegar mixture into rice, cutting and folding rice over itself, trying not to smash or break any grains of rice. Cover with a damp tea towel until ready to serve.

                        SPICY MAYO: In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise and sriracha; season with salt. Taste and add more sriracha, if desired.

                        ASSEMBLY: Step 1 Pat tuna dry, then freeze until just firm, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, then thinly slice or finely chop. Step 2 Divide rice among bowls. Top with cucumbers, avocado, radishes, nori, and fish. Drizzle with soy sauce and spicy mayo. Top with pickled ginger and sesame seeds (if using).
